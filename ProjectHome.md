Screenweaver is software for building Cross-Platform RIDAs (Rich Interfaced Desktop Applications). It separates application logic and application interface concerns, so experts at either end can focus on what they do best.

The Screenweaver software builds a bridge between two very powerful run-time environments: the Neko Virtual Machine, that runs haXe programs, and the Adobe Flash Player, that renders interactive multi-media.

Pre-compiled binaries are available via haXelib. Issue 'haxelib install swhx' from terminal or command prompt. (For more information on how to use haxelib, refer to http://haxe.org, or visit http://screenweaver.com's tutorial section for information on how to install neko, haxe and Screenweaver HX to your system)
