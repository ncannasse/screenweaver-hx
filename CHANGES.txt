KNOWN ISSUES:
	Flash doesn't handle CTRL and ALT key down - bug in FP
	windowless mode, use systools.Misc.getKeyState to work around.

	Flash doesn't handle Scroll-wheel events on Mac.

	Launching applications from terminal on OSX, using $neko xxx.n
	results in crippled UI behavior. Run from the boot loader for
	production.

	Using Adobe Flash player 9, the player's settings dialog doesn't
	allow changing values on the 'privacy' tab. (Win)

	When starting too many concurrent threads (for example
	a lot http requests from flash), crashes might occur.
